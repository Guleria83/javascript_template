                <h1>Road</h1>
                <p>A road is a linear way for the conveyance of traffic that mostly has an improved surface for use
                    by vehicles (motorized and non-motorized) and pedestrians. Unlike streets, the main function of
                    roads is transportation.
                    There are many types of roads, including parkways, avenues, controlled-access highways
                    (freeways, motorways, and expressways), tollways, interstates, highways, thoroughfares, and
                    local roads.

                <h1>Astronaut</h1>
                <p>An astronaut (from the Ancient Greek ἄστρον (astron), meaning 'star', and ναύτης (nautes),
                    meaning
                    'sailor') is a person trained, equipped, and deployed by a human spaceflight program to serve as
                    a
                    commander or crew member aboard a spacecraft. Although generally reserved for professional space
                    travelers, the term is sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space, including scientists,
                    politicians, journalists, and tourists
